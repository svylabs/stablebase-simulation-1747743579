This could involve fetching the state of the `OrderedDoublyLinkedList` contract (nodes, head, tail) from the new snapshot and verifying that the safe's `prev` pointer in the `RedemptionQueueUpdated` event matches the actual previous node ID in the queue. Additionally, verify that the `nodes` mapping in `OrderedDoublyLinkedList` is correctly updated. The existing validation only checks the event emission but does not check state updates on the `OrderedDoublyLinkedList` contract.  To properly implement it, you will need to add code that accesses the snapshot of `OrderedDoublyLinkedList` and then check the state.\n```typescript\nconst orderedDLLPrevious = previousSnapshot.contractSnapshot.orderedDoublyLinkedList;\nconst orderedDLLNew = newSnapshot.contractSnapshot.orderedDoublyLinkedList;\n\n//get the prev node from the event\nlet prevNodeId = BigInt(0);\nif(redemptionQueueUpdatedEvent){\n  const parsedEvent = new ethers.Interface([\"event RedemptionQueueUpdated(uint256 safeId, uint256 weight, uint256 prev)\"]).parseLog(redemptionQueueUpdatedEvent);\n  prevNodeId = parsedEvent.args.prev;\n}\n\nif(prevNodeId != BigInt(0)){\n  expect(orderedDLLNew.nodes[safeId.toString()].prev).to.equal(prevNodeId, \"Previous node id should match the event\");\n}\n```"

    "The implementation covers the main state changes, but was missing crucial checks and relied on simplified assumptions (like no refunds). The code related to fee distribution and redemption queue were not properly validated in the initial action implementation. This version includes fixes for FeeDistributed event parameters, fee refunds, redemption queue state updates, and DFIREStaking/StabilityPool state updates."
